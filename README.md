# VLC-Nightly-Launcher
Powershell script to update (if needed) and launch VLC Nightly (x64)

1. Place the script in the VLC Nightly directory, or in an empty directory
2. Set the correct $LauncherName (i.e. "$LauncherName = vlc_launcher.ps1")
3. optional: use ps2exe to convert the script into an executable file (in this case you have to set $LauncherName = vlc_launcher.exe)
4. optional: point vlc shortcuts to the launcher instead of vlc.exe
5. run the script (or executable)
